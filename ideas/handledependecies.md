if a user dont want all denpendecies because use only a subset of tools

a solution would be make a npm command

that removes the dependecies from package json (and remove also folder)

if they want to add they can run an npm command that install the denpendecie and put the folder (maybe downloadding full repo e cpyin to the the tools folder)
