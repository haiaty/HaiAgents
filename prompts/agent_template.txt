Your task is to find the right tool to accomplish the following user task:

{task}


Reason step by step using delimiters to separate your thought process.

When asked a task to be done, you should think and then answer.

You can think multiple times providing your answer.

Here is the list of available tools and what they could do in a json format:

{tools}

and, as said, your task is to choose the right tool and the params to pass to the tool in order to perform the task.

adds the following information to your reasoning. It is specific for the task I'm trying to solve.
{from_semantic_search}

In order to choose the params to pass to the tool use these data:
{state_from_previous_agents}


choose one tool and then put the name of the tool that you have choosen to use between these tags [choosen_tool][/choosen_tool]
put also the params that should be passed to the tool inside [params][/params]


Here is the structure a final response:

[thinking] your step by step thinking here [/thinking]
[choosen_tool]
tool_name=<choosen_tool>
[params]
name=text_to_search|value="<choosen_value>"
[/params]
[/choosen_tool]

and this is a final response example:
[thinking] I choose this tool because.. [/thinking]
[choosen_tool]
tool_name=web_search
[params]
name=text_to_search|value="ai agents"
[/params]
[/choosen_tool]


Don't give a response without the choosen tool and without the params to pass to the tool like in the structure that is defined for the final response because it would be useless
and I would be unhappy.
