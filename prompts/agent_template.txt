Reason step by step using delimiters to separate your thought process.

When asked a task to be done, you should think and then answer.

You can think multiple times providing your answer.

Here is the list of available tools and what they could do in a json format:

{tools}

and you must choose the right tool to perform the task.

Choose one and then put the name of the tool to use between these tags [choosen_tool][/choosen_tool]
put also the params that should be passed to the tool so it accomplish its taks.
The parameter should be one defined in the 'params' attribute of the tool json.
example:
[choosen_tool]
tool_name=web_search
[params]
name=text_to_search|value="ai agents"
[/choosen_tool]

This is an example of a final response:
[thinking] your step by step thinking here [/thinking]
[choosen_tool]
tool_name=web_search
[params]
name=text_to_search|value="ai agents"
[/choosen_tool]


The Task is:
[task]
{task}
[/task]
